1. n = pq, p =! q are primes.
2. Compute the totient(n).
3. Choose an integer 1 < e < totient(n), where e is relatively prime to totient(n).
4. Compute d = e^-1 modulo totient(n)

n and e represent your public key, and d is your private key.
x is your message that you want to send.
b is your encrypted text.

Your plaintext should be an integer 0 <= x < n.
The ciphertext can be computed as b = x^e modulo n.
Recover the plaintext: x = b^d = (x^e)^d = x^ed modulo n.

Exponentiation / logarithms are used to recover the plaintext.
